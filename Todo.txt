1.) Create DataBase system to begin collecting price data (and other forms of data down the line) using SQLite
2.) Figure out a way to retrieve price data and save it to the database (web scraping?), preferably running 24/7 on a virtual machine 
3.) Create a backtesting library
3.) Determine a trading strategy
4.) Use AlpacaAPI to execute trades (in python)

Neural network, 1 input layer 1 neuron, 1 hidden layer 2 neurons, 1 output layer 1 neuron,

suppose the value x = 2 is fed forward with the corresponding label 7 and weight matrices of hidden layer initialized to a square 2 x 2 matrix full of twos and output layer weight matrix a 1 x 3 matrix also initialized to 2s and has a ReLU activation function, suppose I am including the bias in the weight matrix (it is being calculated alongside all other weights) walk through a forward pass explaining all of the shapes at each stage and then walk through a backward pass doing the same thing
